# Ames Housing Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis and prediction of housing prices based on the Ames Housing Dataset. The methodology adopted involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning models.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Libraries Imported: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and more for data manipulation and mathematical operations.
- Data Imported: The Ames housing dataset was loaded for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Overview of Dataset: Utilized functions like `df.columns`, `df.head()`, `df.tail()`, and `df.describe()` to understand the structure and statistical summary of the data.
- Missing Values: Analyzed and handled missing data using methods like `isnull()` and `sum()`.
- Feature Transformation: Created new features and combined existing ones to improve model accuracy.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Combined features to reduce redundancy (e.g., total number of bathrooms, garage capacity).
- Created new features to better represent aspects of the houses (e.g., age of the house at the time of sale).

### 4. Model Implementation
- Data Encoding: Applied label encoding and one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
- Dataset Splitting: Partitioned the data into training and testing sets.
- Feature Scaling: Normalized the feature set using `MinMaxScaler`.

### 5. Model Training and Evaluation
- Applied various regression models including Lasso, XGBoost, and Decision Tree Regressor.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Results
- The models' performances were assessed based on their R-squared values, with XGBoost performing notably well.
- The insights from the analysis and the predictive models provide a deep understanding of the factors influencing house prices in Ames, Iowa.

## Conclusion
The study delivers valuable predictions and highlights the importance of feature engineering and model selection in predicting housing prices. This analysis can assist real estate stakeholders in making informed decisions.
